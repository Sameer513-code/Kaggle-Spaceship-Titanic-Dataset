# Kaggle-Spaceship-Titanic-Dataset

The Task: We have to create a model which will predict which passengers have been transported.<br>
<br>
Before Implementation, I need to first learn the workflow of building any model.<br>
<br>
Here it is.<br>
1. Frame the problem and look at the big picture.<br>
2. Get the data.<br>
3. Explore the data to gain insights.<br>
4. Work on Feature selection. Prepare the data to better expose the underlying data patterns to Machine Learning algorithms.<br>
5. Explore many different models and short-list the best ones.<br>
6. Fine-tune your models and combine them into a great solution.<br>
7. Present your solution.<br>
8. Launch, monitor, and maintain your system.<br>
<br>
1. Frame the problem<br>
We're challenged to predict which passengers were transported by the anomaly using records recovered from the spaceshipâ€™s damaged computer system.<br>
<br>
2. Get the data<br>
I've gathered the data from Kaggle's data repository.<br>
3. Explore the data<br>
Know the data type of each field. Check for duplicates and errors in values. Errors can be fixed using skip function from pandas. Check for null values. If percentage of null values is small then just replace them with with best suitable values according to the data.<br>
Find relation between features using graphs like histogram, scatterplot, heatmap.
