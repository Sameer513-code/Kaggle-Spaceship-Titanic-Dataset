# Kaggle Spaceship Titanic Dataset

## Objective  
The goal of this project is to build a **machine learning model** that predicts whether a passenger has been transported or not.  

Before implementing models, I followed a structured **machine learning workflow**:  

### Machine Learning Workflow  
1. **Frame the Problem** ‚Äì Define the objective clearly.  
2. **Gather Data** ‚Äì Obtain and preprocess the dataset.  
3. **Explore the Data** ‚Äì Perform data analysis to find patterns.  
4. **Feature Engineering** ‚Äì Select and transform features to improve performance.  
5. **Train Different Models** ‚Äì Compare multiple models and select the best ones.  
6. **Fine-tune the Models** ‚Äì Optimize hyperparameters for better accuracy.  
7. **Evaluate and Compare Performance** ‚Äì Choose the best-performing model.  
8. **Deploy & Monitor** ‚Äì Integrate the model into an application if needed.

## Models Implemented  

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Logistic Regression  
**Algorithm:**  
- A simple linear model for binary classification.  

**Advantages:**  
- Easy to implement and interpret.  
- Computationally efficient.  
- Works well on small datasets.  

**Disadvantages:**  
- Assumes a **linear relationship** between features and the target.  
- Not suitable for **complex relationships**.  

**Hyperparameters Used:**  
```python
solver = 'liblinear'  # Optimization algorithm
C = 1.0  # Regularization strength (smaller = stronger regularization)
```

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Random Forest  
**Algorithm:**  
- An ensemble method that builds multiple decision trees and combines their results.  

**Advantages:**  
- Reduces overfitting compared to single decision trees.  
- Handles **missing values** and **categorical data** well.  

**Disadvantages:**  
- Computationally **expensive**, especially for large datasets.  
- Less **interpretable** compared to simpler models.  

**Hyperparameters Used:**  
```python
n_estimators = 100  # Number of trees in the forest
max_depth = None  # Maximum depth of each tree
min_samples_split = 2  # Minimum samples required to split a node
```

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ XGBoost  
**Algorithm:**  
- A gradient boosting model optimized for speed and performance.  

**Advantages:**  
- Handles missing values efficiently.  
- Works well with structured/tabular data.  
- Achieves **high accuracy**.  

**Disadvantages:**  
- Requires careful **hyperparameter tuning**.  
- Can **overfit** if not regularized properly.  

**Hyperparameters Used:**  
```python
learning_rate = 0.1  # Step size at each iteration
n_estimators = 100  # Number of boosting rounds
max_depth = 6  # Maximum depth of a tree
subsample = 0.8  # Fraction of samples used per boosting round
```

## Model Performance  
| Model                | Accuracy |
|----------------------|---------|
| Logistic Regression | 78%     |
| Random Forest       | 85%     |
| XGBoost            | 88%     |

## Future Improvements  
- **Feature Engineering** ‚Äì Create new meaningful features to boost performance.  
- **Hyperparameter Optimization** ‚Äì Use **GridSearchCV** or **RandomizedSearchCV** to find optimal parameters.  
- **Stacking Models** ‚Äì Combine multiple models for even better predictions.  
- **Handling Class Imbalance** ‚Äì Try **SMOTE** or **weighted loss functions** if needed.
